/*There are mainly Three Types Of Styling:
1.inline styling : 
 Direct Application: Apply styles directly to HTML elements using 
the style attribute. 
• One-off Changes: Ideal for single, unique style alterations.
 • Can Be Cluttered: May lead to cluttered HTML if used extensively.
 • Limited Reusability: Reduces the reusability of CSS rules in larger 
projects

2.Internal Syling:
• Embedded CSS: Styles are placed within <style> tags in the 
HTML head section. 
• Cleaner than Inline: More organized compared to inline styles.
 • Reusable Styles: Allows for some reuse of styles across the 
page.

External Styling : 
• Separate CSS File: Stores styles in a separate .css file, linked to HTML. 
• Reusable: Enables style reuse across multiple webpages.
 • Link in HTML: Use the <link> tag within the <head> section to link the CSS.
 • Relative or Absolute Path: The href attribute can contain a relative or 
absolute path to the CSS file.
